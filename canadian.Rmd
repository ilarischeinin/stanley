1. Canadian programming
-----------------------

Since the contemporary form of ice hockey is in essence a Canadian sport,
as a sign of appreciation I have written this project following conventions of
[Canadian programming](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/5576). For
example, instead of function `is.numeric()`, I'm using `numeric.eh()`.

These function definitions are stored in file `canadian.R`,
which is `source()`'d to other scripts used.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source("canadian.R")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
cat(readLines("canadian.R"), sep="\n")
```
