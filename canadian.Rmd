1. Canadian programming
-----------------------

Since the contemporary form of ice hockey is in essence a Canadian sport,
I have written this project following conventions of
[Canadian programming](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/5576). For
example, instead of function `is.numeric()`, I'm using `numeric.eh()`.

These function definitions are stored in file `canadian.R`,
which is `source()`'d to each one of the processing scripts.

```{r}
source("canadian.R", echo=TRUE)
```
